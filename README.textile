h1. Custom FTP Server

h2. A FTP Server running on ruby that can be customised to respond to FTP calls however seen fit

This is a new project I am working on as part of a larger project, but I saw lots of use for this in the open-source community and hope for it to be a goto solution for people trying to achieve a similar solution.

**Custom FTP Server** will be a ruby base FTP server solution that will allow you to customise how **you** want to respond to certain FTP requests, allowing you to customise the whole range of FTP functions.

Right now, I haven't even gotten started on this, I'm just putting up a GitHub repository so people can watch, which you really should, it should end up working pretty well, and be a good solution for any time you want to customise how a FTP server should act, or if you just want a small simple FTP server to use.

Two example I plan to make during testing are:

**Example 1** - Rackspace CloudFiles interface

Now I know that you can use CloudFiles with some FTP programs, but I will make it so:

# It works with **all** FTP clients (or at least most...)
# It stores headers and some other data in a database (hopefully by integrating with a Ruby on Rails application)

**Example 2** - Flickr FTP Server

This was an idea I had to see how well it could really go with integrating with APIs and just how custom it could get.

The Flickr FTP Server will let you start up a server where you can login to you FTP client using your Flickr login, and upload images to Flickr through your FTP client. Why you would want to I have no idea, but it might be a nice example.

h2. Updates are going to be regular

**So keep coming back**, I'd really like some feedback too, or some tips if you hear of anything that might help.

h2. Yes there are libraries like this out there

But they are not update regularly, and look pretty overly complicated, code is messy, etc. etc.

This is why I am making my own, so I can make it available to the world for use, if anyone finds a use (I have a good one in mind, that's why I want to make it so bad)
